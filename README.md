# Columns in Bootstrap 4

Welcome to Columns in Bootstrap 4.  The purpose of this project is to investigate the columns in Bootstrap 4.

## UX

This project is about computing.  The columns are structured into Office, Programming and Other Skills.
The organising principle is Skills or Interests.

### User Stories

As a user, I want to see each column in a different background colour.  The first column (office) has a light blue
background colour.  The second column (programming) has a light green background colour.  The third column (other skills)
has a pink background colour.

As a user, I want to have Font Awesome Icons in each column heading.  For example, the heading office would have the Excel
(Spreadsheet) symbol displayed.

## Features

This project has three columns.
